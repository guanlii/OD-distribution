# OD-distribution

There are four steps of transportation planning:
1. Trip Generation
2. Trip Distribution
3. Mode Split
4. Trip Assignment

This project is mainly used for the first two steps. You can enter a table containing the attributes of the travel analysis zones (TAZs) and get the table of departures and arrivals between TAZs.

After that, you can use some traffic assgnment software to calculate and display the result.
